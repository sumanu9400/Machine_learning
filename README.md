🤖 Machine Learning Practice – Google Colab

This repository contains my Machine Learning practice notebooks created in Google Colab. I’m learning how to work with data, build ML models, and analyze results using popular Python libraries.

🔍 Concepts Covered

NumPy – numerical operations

Pandas – loading and cleaning datasets

Matplotlib & Seaborn – visualizing data

Train/Test Split – preparing data for model training

Statsmodels – building statistical models

Mean Squared Error (MSE) – measuring model error

R² Score – checking model accuracy
